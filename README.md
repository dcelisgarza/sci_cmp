# Scientific Computing Workshop

## Introduction

My undergrad university has a week every year when students stop studying whatever they signed up for and are forced to enroll in an arbitrary workshop. Often, such workshops _suck_ and those that don't, cost a lot of money. Which leaves a lot of people having to suck it up and learn nothing for a week straight. Thanks to Honda's old ![ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cgdM0gWGoU), I have to change what I hate.

This workshop be catered towards scientific applications so not a lot of algorithms or advanced data structures.
